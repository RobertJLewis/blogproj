# Introduction:
### Project Milestone 3: for Code Institute Full-Stack Development Program: Django Framework
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Django framework with Python on the back end to deliver an intuitive, interactive blog-sharing platform. The application adopts a Reddit-style structure, enabling users to register, authenticate, and manage their accounts seamlessly. Within the platform, users can create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as engage with others by posting comments and liking & disliking content.

Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality has been implemented for user accounts, blog posts, and comments, ensuring that users retain full control over their contributions and may update or remove their content at any time. An integrated admin panel provides moderation capabilities and allows users to submit support requests or feature suggestions directly through the platform.

## Strategy Plane
### Project Goals
Threadly is a community-driven gaming blog platform designed for gamers, content creators, and enthusiasts. It enables users to sign up, log in, and share posts on a wide range of gaming topics, from reviews and tips to news and discussions. Users can create, edit, and delete their posts, interact with others through comments and likes, and browse content organised by date posted.

The platform replaces the limitations of static gaming blogs with a dynamic, mobile-responsive, and user-friendly interface. Whether at home, at an event, or on the go, users can easily read, contribute to, and engage with the latest gaming content.

As the gaming industry continues to expand, tools like Threadly empower players and creators to connect, share insights, and build communities in a modern, cloud-based environment. Developed as part of a Level 5 Web Application Development course, the project focuses on usability, clean design, and practical functionality to deliver a polished gaming blog experience.

### Target Audience
Threadly is designed for:
  - üéÆ **Gamers** ‚Äì Share reviews, tips, and gaming news with a like-minded community  
  - üìù **Content creators** ‚Äì Post and manage your own gaming-related articles and updates  
  - üì± **Mobile users** ‚Äì Access and contribute to the platform on the go  
  - ü§ù **Community members** ‚Äì Comment, like, and engage with posts from other users  

### Key Features
  - üìù **User-generated content** ‚Äì Create, edit, and manage your own gaming posts  
  - üí¨ **Community interaction** ‚Äì Comment on and like posts to engage with others  
  - üõ†Ô∏è **Full CRUD functionality** ‚Äì Add, view, update, or remove your content at any time  
  - üîê **Secure authentication** ‚Äì Personalised accounts with registration, login, and logout  
  - üì± **Responsive UI** ‚Äì Optimised for smartphones, tablets, and desktops  



## Scope Plane
### Feature Planning
The Threadly project has been carefully planned to prioritise core functionality for the minimum viable product (MVP) while identifying additional features for future development. Features are categorised as **must-haves**, **should-haves**, and **could-haves** based on their importance and viability.

The MVP focuses on essential functionality for all users, including viewing the public landing page, registering for an account, logging in and out, managing sessions, creating, editing, and deleting posts, commenting on and liking posts, and accessing a responsive, mobile-first interface. Admin users also have access to the Django admin panel for moderation and content management.

Should-have features include filtering and sorting posts by category or date, searching posts by title, author, or keywords, and updating personal account profiles. Could-have features for future iterations include social media login/signup, bookmarking favourite posts, viewing analytics dashboards, and enhanced customisation options.

By defining the scope in this way, Threadly ensures a clear focus on delivering a seamless user experience while allowing room for expansion and additional functionality in later versions.



## Structure Plane
### User Stories
The Threadly platform has been designed around clear user stories to guide the structure and functionality of the app. These stories ensure the site meets the needs of different user types, including guests, registered users, admins, and mobile users.

**Guest users** can browse public posts and featured content to understand what the platform offers before registering. They see clear prompts to sign up or log in, making it easy to get started.  

**Registered users** can create an account, log in, and access their dashboard. They can add, edit, and delete posts, upload images to enhance their content, and engage with other users through comments and likes. Additional features include searching, filtering, and sorting posts to quickly find content, rating posts to track favourites, and managing their account details, such as updating their display name or profile information. 

**Admins** have access to a dedicated Django admin panel to manage users and content efficiently. They can edit or delete any posts, review user-submitted content to ensure the platform remains appropriate, and manage posts directly from the admin interface.  

**Mobile users** can access Threadly on smartphones and tablets, allowing them to read, create, and update posts while on the go. Image uploads and post creation are optimised for mobile, enabling a seamless experience across devices.  

Finally, all users are provided with friendly, informative error pages (e.g., 404 or 500) and see their most recent posts first in their dashboard, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and a smooth user experience.



## Database Schema
Threadly uses a relational database (PostgreSQL) to provide structured and reliable storage, with support for referential integrity, ideal for managing user accounts, posts, comments, and likes.

The MVP initially focused on a **Post** model linked to Django‚Äôs built-in **User** model. Each post stores core information such as title, content, category, creation date, and an optional image. This setup enabled rapid prototyping, full CRUD functionality, and integration with the Django admin panel.

During development, it became clear that additional granularity was needed to support user interactions such as comments and likes. To address this, dedicated **Comment** and **Like** models were introduced. Each comment is linked to a post and its author, while likes are linked to both the user and the post, establishing clear one-to-many relationships. This structure improves data accuracy, scalability, and the ability to extend functionality in the future, such as filtering posts, sorting by popularity, or displaying user interactions at the post level.

The schema follows relational database best practices, reducing redundancy, maintaining clarity, and supporting future enhancements to Threadly‚Äôs interactive features.



## Skeleton Plane
### Wireframes
The initial wireframes for Threadly were created using **Adobe Illustrator** to plan the layout, structure, and user flow of the gaming blog platform. Wireframes were designed for **mobile, tablet, and desktop** screens to ensure a fully responsive and accessible experience across all devices.

These wireframes established the information hierarchy and guided the user journey, covering key views such as the homepage, dashboard, post creation and management pages, and error pages. They provided a visual blueprint throughout development, helping to determine the placement of navigation, search, filter, and CRUD elements with a **mobile-first approach**.


<img src="/assets/images/wireframe.png">



## Surface Plane
### Colour Scheme
The Threadly colour palette draws inspiration from vibrant gaming aesthetics, combining **blue and pink tones** to create a modern, energetic, and immersive feel. The scheme balances clarity and readability with playful accents, reflecting the dynamic world of gaming and community interaction.

The main colours for the site are:
  - **(Gaming Blue)** ‚Äì Used for headings, buttons, and hyperlinks. This bright blue adds a bold, confident tone while maintaining clarity and consistency across the interface.  
  - **(Pixel Pink)** ‚Äì Applied to call-to-actions, badges, and hover states, this vibrant pink introduces energy and highlights key interactive elements.  
  - **(Smoke White)** ‚Äì Utilised for the footer, navigation, and text on light backgrounds. It provides contrast, grounding the interface and ensuring readability.  
  - **(Background Grey)** ‚Äì A soft, neutral background colour that keeps the focus on content and enhances the visibility of the primary accents.  
  - **(Foreground White)** ‚Äì Used for text, icons, and forms on coloured or dark backgrounds, ensuring clean, crisp readability across all devices.  

These colours are defined as **CSS variables** for consistent application throughout the platform, resulting in a cohesive and visually engaging aesthetic that complements Threadly‚Äôs focus on gaming and community engagement.





### Typography
Threadly uses **Google Fonts** to ensure high-quality, accessible typography across all devices and browsers. Fonts are imported using CSS `@import`, with appropriate fallbacks for maximum compatibility.

  - **Headings (h1, h2, h3):** The font **Poppins** was selected for all headings due to its geometric, modern style. Its clean lines and contemporary design make headlines stand out, giving the site a polished, distinctive visual identity while remaining highly legible.  
  - **Paragraphs and body text:** **Poppins** is also used for body copy, maintaining consistency while providing excellent readability at various sizes. Its friendly, modern tone complements the gaming-inspired colour palette, creating a cohesive and user-friendly reading experience throughout the site.  
  - **Icons and UI elements:** The **Font Awesome** library supports the interface with scalable, recognisable icons. These icons are stylistically aligned with Poppins, enhancing usability by providing clear visual cues for actions, navigation, and social interactions.  

Together, this typographic approach balances style and readability, contributing to Threadly‚Äôs modern, vibrant, and accessible gaming blog design.



### Imagery
All images used in Threadly were sourced from a variety of online platforms and are **not intended for commercial use**. The visuals were selected to reflect gaming culture and to enhance the immersive experience of the blog.  

Example images used for posts, banners, and thumbnails are intended to demonstrate how the platform displays content and populate the interface in a realistic way. These images provide context for the layout and functionality, helping users visualise their own posts and interactions within the platform.  

Overall, the imagery is clean, bold, and culturally relevant to gaming, reinforcing Threadly‚Äôs purpose as a community-driven, interactive blog for gamers.



## Features

### Deployment & Local Development 
Deployment ‚Ä®The Vinyl Crate project is deployed using Heroku, with Amazon RDS PostgreSQL for the live database. Create the Live Database While sqlite3 was used for local development, this is not suitable for production. Instead, a free-tier PostgreSQL database from Amazon AWS was used for deployment.
  1. Sign in to your Amazon RDS Console and click Create Database.
  2. Select Standard Create, choose PostgreSQL, and select the Free tier template.
  3. Set a unique DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
  4. In the connectivity section, enable public access and ensure security group rules allow inbound connections from your IP.
  5. Launch the database and wait for the instance to become available.
  6. Once ready, copy the Endpoint and construct your DATABASE_URL in the following format: postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/dbname



### Heroku App Setup
1. In the Heroku Dashboard, click New ‚Üí Create new app.
2. Name your app uniquely, select a region, and click Create App.
3. Go to the Settings tab ‚Üí Reveal Config Vars ‚Üí Add: DATABASE_URL: paste your constructed PostgreSQL URL (no quotes)

## Preparation for Deployment in VS Code (with PostgreSQL on AWS)
1. Install required packages Install dj_database_url and psycopg2 to enable Django to connect to an external PostgreSQL database: pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2 

2. Freeze dependencies Save the installed packages to your requirements.txt: pip3 freeze > requirements.txt 

3. Update settings.py Add the following import near the top of settings.py: import dj_database_url 

4. Temporarily connect to AWS PostgreSQL In settings.py, comment out the default DATABASES block and add the following (replace with your actual AWS RDS connection string): DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse('your-aws-rds-db-url-here') } 

5. Test connection Run the server to confirm the connection works: python3 manage.py runserver 

6. Apply migrations to AWS If successful, migrate your models to the new external database: python3 manage.py migrate 

7. Create a superuser Set up admin access on the new database: python3 manage.py createsuperuser 

8. Switch between local and external DB automatically Replace the temporary block in settings.py with the following conditional logic: 
'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ: 
DATABASES = { 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')) } 
else: 
DATABASES = { 'default': { 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3', } } 

9. Install Gunicorn Add Gunicorn to serve your Django app in production: pip3 install gunicorn pip3 freeze > requirements.txt 

10. Create a Procfile In the root of your project, create a file named Procfile with the following line (no extension, no blank line below): web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi:application 

11. Disable collectstatic on Heroku (for now) Prevent Heroku from trying to collect static files during deployment: heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app your-heroku-app-name 

12. Update allowed hosts In settings.py, update ALLOWED_HOSTS to include Heroku and local development: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost'] 

13. Commit and push changes Save all changes, commit, and push to GitHub: git add . git commit -m "Prepare for Heroku deployment with AWS DB" git push origin main 

14. Connect to Heroku Git and deploy Link your repo and deploy: heroku git:remote -a your-heroku-app-name git push heroku main 

15. Verify deployment Your site should now be live (without static files). Re-enable collectstatic and confirm static assets are served correctly. 

16. Enable automatic deploys Go to your Heroku app‚Äôs Deploy tab: 
	- Connect your GitHub repo 
	- Click Enable Automatic Deploys



## Generating a Secure SECRET_KEY & Configuring DEBUG Settings
When a Django project is created, it includes a default `SECRET_KEY`. Using the default key in production is a security risk. For Threadly, a strong, unique key should be generated and stored securely.
  1. Use a tool like the [Django Secret Key Generator](https://djecrety.ir/) to create a random, secure key. Copy the generated key.
  2. In your **Heroku Dashboard**, navigate to your app‚Äôs **Settings** tab and add a new **Config Var**:
      Key: SECRET_KEY Value: <paste your generated secret key>
  3. In `settings.py`, update the `SECRET_KEY` definition to retrieve the value from the environment:
      import os
      SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', ' ')
  4. Update the DEBUG setting so it is only enabled during development:
    DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
  5. Save your changes, then commit and push to GitHub:
      git add .
      git commit -m "Configure SECRET_KEY and DEBUG for secure deployment"
      git push origin main.
